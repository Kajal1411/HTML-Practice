    <p>
        <h4>Backend:</h4>
           <b>What it is:</b>The server-side of the website that processes data and logic. <br>
           <b>Responsibilities: </b>Manages data, databases, and server logic. <br>

    <h2>Que.3 What is static webpage?</h2>
    <p>
        A static webpage is a type of webpage that displays the same content to every visitor. The content of a static webpage is fixed and doesn't change unless manually updated by the website's developer. These pages are usually written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), and they do not have any interactive or dynamic features, such as forms or databases.
    </p>

    <h2>Que.4 What is dynamic webpage?</h2>
    <p>
        A dynamic webpage is a webpage that can display different content based on user interactions, preferences, or real-time data. Unlike static webpages, dynamic webpages can change their content and appearance without requiring a full page reload. These pages are often generated using server-side programming languages (such as PHP, Python, or Node.js) and may involve client-side scripting (like JavaScript) to make the page interactive.

    <h2>Que.5 what is client-server mechanism?</h2>
    <p>
        The client-server mechanism for frontend involves the communication between the user interface (frontend) and the server (backend). When a user interacts with the frontend, like clicking a button or submitting a form, the frontend sends a request to the server. The server processes the request, often querying a database, and sends back a response (like data in JSON format). The frontend then updates the user interface based on this response, providing a dynamic experience without reloading the entire page. This mechanism helps keep the user experience smooth and interactive by separating the user interface from the data processing.

    <h2>Que.6 What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design webpages. It provides the structure of a webpage by using a system of elements (tags) to define content types, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, forms, and more.

    <h2>Que.7 What is mean by HyperText?</h2>
    <p>
        Hypertext refers to text that contains links (known as hyperlinks) to other documents, webpages, or resources on the internet. These links allow users to navigate easily between related pieces of information by clicking on them.
    </p>

    <h2>Que.8 What is mean by Markup language?</h2>
    <p>
        A Markup Language is a system for annotating or "marking up" text in a document to define its structure and presentation. The annotations are written using tags or codes that are interpreted by a computer to format, structure, or display the content.
    </p>

    <h2>Que.9 Who developed HTML?</h2>
    <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was developed by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, in 1991. He created it while working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) as a way to share and link documents over the internet.
