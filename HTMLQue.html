    <h2>Que.3 What is static webpage?</h2>
    <p>
        A static webpage is a type of webpage that displays the same content to every visitor. The content of a static webpage is fixed and doesn't change unless manually updated by the website's developer. These pages are usually written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), and they do not have any interactive or dynamic features, such as forms or databases.

    <h2>Que.4 What is dynamic webpage?</h2>
    <p>
        A dynamic webpage is a webpage that can display different content based on user interactions, preferences, or real-time data. Unlike static webpages, dynamic webpages can change their content and appearance without requiring a full page reload. These pages are often generated using server-side programming languages (such as PHP, Python, or Node.js) and may involve client-side scripting (like JavaScript) to make the page interactive.

    <h2>Que.5 what is client-server mechanism?</h2>
    <p>
        The client-server mechanism for frontend involves the communication between the user interface (frontend) and the server (backend). When a user interacts with the frontend, like clicking a button or submitting a form, the frontend sends a request to the server. The server processes the request, often querying a database, and sends back a response (like data in JSON format). The frontend then updates the user interface based on this response, providing a dynamic experience without reloading the entire page. This mechanism helps keep the user experience smooth and interactive by separating the user interface from the data processing.
